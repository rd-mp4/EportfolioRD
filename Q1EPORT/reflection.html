            <p> Let me paint you a picture of my first quarter: it was like <b>standing in the middle of a storm</b>, with subjects wirling around, mimicking fierce winds. The <b><i>pressure of being in a star section weighed heavily on my shoulders</i></b>, and along the way, I lost some friends who were once the colors of my life. I have mostly been alone nowadays, and it's extremely hard to get into good spirits. Performance tasks felt like walls too high to climb, and the quizzes kept piling up like raindrops in a flood. The disappointment I felt in receiving a dull grade, seeing people enjoy things without me, and the lack of self confidence.. it was all hard to juggle. My experience so far has been a struggle to keep enduring, as if I'm walking through thick mud.
            But amid the storm, there was a rainbow. Numbing myself became my break from the chaos. Looking into life in a positive way offered a burst of light cutting through clouds. I very much enjoyed the lessons in ICT. It made me interested in the topic, as I actually got a chance to learn and code. These experiences felt like the colors of a rainbow, each memory shining with its own sense of excitement and promise. The motivation I found within myself helped me stay focus, reminding me that even after the hardest storms, there's still something bright waiting at the end. <b><u> There's always a reason to keep learning, no matter how tough things get. </u></b>
